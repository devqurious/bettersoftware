Actually, you’re just the janitor. 

But add a chief, as it just sounds cooler. Once the product is conceptualised, the team hired, and the sprints started, your job is to clean the shit that will now begin. People will fall sick. Legal issues will brew. Unexpected technical challenges will come up. Intra-division and intra-people politics will take place. Laptops will die.  Even the cafeteria food will become a topic of conversation. So will attrition. Bugs are piling up. That great architect you hired? Well, he hates the rest of team and vice versa. Nothing moves. 

At some point you might be left wondering what is it you handle because you’re doing so many disparate things. But you are doing all those things for one, and only one, goal - to ship the software. 

Your goal is to ship the software on time and with acceptable quality. That’s it. Software that is sitting in a repository and not in production has zero value, no matter how brilliant the code may be. 

Every day you come to work, your sole purpose is to deploy, or be closer to the first/next deployment.
